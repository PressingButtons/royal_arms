  I see there are some hiccups with the current rendering code.
  Slight flickering and stretchiness(?) occuring at the edges.
  The cropping for sprites/tilemaps are done via math rather than set values.
  will have to address that in the future.

  Basic tile collision is in place.

  Need to create a custom frame editor
  Frame [
    sprite index
    duration
    updates objects hurt, hit and body boxes
    function to execute while on index
  ]
  an object holding animation arrays and an object that houses
  each frames data?
}
